     * This method imports all the data included in the backup file inside the main database.

     * The import is built in a staging file beside the live database and put in place only once
     * every row is in, so a failure leaves the live database untouched. Nothing has to be rolled
     * back and no copy of the ledger is kept aside while this runs, which is what the design
     * before this one needed and this one does not.

     * @param databaseFolder folder where the database is located.

     * Only this thread is sent to the staging file. The rest of the app keeps reading and
     * writing the live ledger while the import runs, so a screen open during a restore shows
     * the old data until the swap and then redraws, instead of watching rows appear.
     *
     * A write made from another thread while this runs therefore goes into the ledger that is
     * about to be replaced, and is lost. That is what this app already did and it is deliberate.
     * Sending every thread to the staging file instead would keep such a write, by putting it in
     * a half imported database whose ids name different rows with foreign keys on, and it would
     * make the live file name movable, which costs a lock on every read in the app. Refusing
     * those writes was also built and reverted. The refusal reaches the caller as an exception,
     * no caller on any of these write paths catches it, and injecting that throw into the
     * recurrence job on an emulator ended the run with FATAL EXCEPTION on the AsyncTask that
     * JobIntentService dispatches on, with the process gone. Every component here shares that
     * one process, so the restore died with it.
     *
     * What this does NOT cover is the attachments. BackupHandlerIntentService runs importDatabase
     * and then importAttachments, and importAttachments empties the attachment folder before it
     * extracts anything, so a failure there leaves the new ledger live and the files gone. True
     * before this change and not made worse by it. No sentence anywhere may call the restore
     * atomic without naming it.
