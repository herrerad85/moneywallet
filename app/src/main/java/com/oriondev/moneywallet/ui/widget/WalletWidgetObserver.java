/**
 * Pushes a redraw to the placed widgets whenever anything that can move a wallet balance is
 * written.
 *
 * A balance does not only move when a transaction row is written, and the provider notifies the
 * URI a write came through. A transfer notifies transfers, a debt with a master transaction
 * notifies debts, and deleting a savings goal takes its transactions with it while notifying
 * savings, so all of them put rows in or out of the transaction table the wallet total is summed
 * from. Listening to transactions alone would leave a widget showing the figure from before a
 * transfer until something unrelated was saved.
 *
 * The first four are what the wallet list cursor is registered on in DataContentProvider. Savings
 * is the one this needs and that cursor does not, since a goal is deleted from a screen that
 * rebuilds the wallet list on its way back anyway.
 *
 * This is what keeps the widget level with the app. The slow period in widget_wallet_info covers
 * the other half, a transaction dated ahead coming due, which no write announces.
