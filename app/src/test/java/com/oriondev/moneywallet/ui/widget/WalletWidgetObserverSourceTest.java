/**
 * One registration that nothing which runs can check, pinned as text the way
 * DataContentProviderTransactionSourceTest pins what the provider's write methods must be reached
 * by. There is no way to ask the framework what it was asked to watch, and the instrumented case
 * that registers the same way pins what the framework does with those arguments and not that this
 * file passes them.
 *
 * Both arguments are all or nothing. Nothing announces CONTENT_ALL itself, so without the
 * descendants flag the widget is told about no write at all, and a narrower uri is the list this
 * change deleted coming back one entity at a time. Neither failure says anything at run time, the
 * widget just holds the figure it was drawn with.
 *
 * The lock in MultiUriCursorWrapper.registerContentObserver is NOT pinned here, and a case for it
 * was written and taken out again. The property is mutual exclusion between two methods, and a
 * check that reads the file can only see a token: three separate ways were found to leave that
 * token in place with the exclusion gone, and each pattern written to close one of them let
 * another through or failed on code that was right. A check that says a property holds when it
 * does not is worse than not having one, so what guards that lock is the comment on it.
 *
 * Comments and literals are stripped before matching, for the reason the precedent gives: an
 * assertion here must not be satisfied by a comment describing code the file no longer has. What
 * is matched allows any spacing, so rewrapping a line is not a failure. What it cannot see is a
 * call that is there and never reached.
 *
 * A failure means read the source and decide, not that the app is broken.
