/**
 * The deadlock this class was rewritten to remove needed two things at once: a reader of the cache
 * that could block on a lock, and a reload that held that same lock while it read the database.
 * An importer runs a whole import inside one transaction, which holds the single SQLite connection
 * the app shares, and asks this class for a currency on every row. So the importer waited on the
 * lock while the reload waited on the connection.
 *
 * Only one of those two has to go for the cycle to be impossible, and it is the readers that went.
 * If nothing a thread inside a transaction can call acquires anything, that thread can never be
 * made to wait inside this class, whatever invalidateCache does. READERS below is every such
 * method, and it has to stay that way if a new one is added.
 *
 * invalidateCache does still hold a lock across the database, because two reloads have to be kept
 * from interleaving and nothing cheaper orders them correctly, and so does initialize, which does
 * the same load. That is safe only while the two things the second and third cases pin stay true:
 * nothing but those two takes that lock, and neither is called from inside a transaction. Both
 * refuse at runtime if anything does.
 *
 * What this is and is not. It reads the source and matches text, so it is a tripwire against the
 * old code coming back, not a proof that the new code is correct. Someone determined to reintroduce
 * a lock can pick a spelling none of these look for. The behavior that can be run instead is in
 * CurrencyManagerConcurrencyTest. Comments and string literals are stripped first, so nothing here
 * can be satisfied by a comment describing code the file no longer has, and whitespace is collapsed
 * so a statement may be wrapped, following ReportLoaderSourceTest.
 *
 * A failure means read the source and decide, not that the cache is broken.
